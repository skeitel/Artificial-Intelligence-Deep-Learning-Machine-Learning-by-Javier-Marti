I use the full power of Artificial Intelligence, machine and deep learning techniques to make accurate and profitable predictions about people, products, services and trends.
Artificial intelligence has many applications in today's society. A.I. programs are developed to perform specific tasks for a wide range of activities including medical diagnosis, electronic trading, robot control, and remote sensing. AI has been used to develop and advance numerous fields and industries, including finance, healthcare, education, transportation, and more.

"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a lot of things. It's a game changer for business, it can enable humans to work smarter and faster than ever before, and it could potentially have a significant impact on economies and the labor market.
But at the root of it all – the function which gives AI value – is the ability to make predictions. Calculating – more quickly and accurately than has ever been possible – what the likelihood is of a particular outcome, is the fundamental advance which AI brings to the table.

About Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

These are specific implementations of technology which can be used to give machines the ability to learn, without human input, by merely being fed data.
This means they can become increasingly better at routine tasks – such as examining image data from cameras and working out what is shown, or reading through thousands of pages of documents and understanding the relevant pieces of information for the task at hand.

In business, we have to make these predictions many, many times each day. Will we make a higher profit by selling large volumes cheaply, or small volumes at a high price? Who is the best team member to take on a job? Where will we get the best "bang for our buck" out of our marketing budget?

Traditionally these predictions relied heavily on “gut instinct” – what our intuition or experience tells us is the likely outcome. They are data-driven too of course – our instincts are informed by what we’ve learned, but there’s only so much time that can be spent reading reports and books.

That generally isn't a constraint for a computer – which, if given the right algorithms, can automatically ingest vast amounts of data and use it to make predictions more quickly and accurately than we could ever hope to ourselves."
